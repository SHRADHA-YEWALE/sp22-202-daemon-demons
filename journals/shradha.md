### Team Feedback
We team members had our 1st meeting in the 1st week. Every team member were exploring the project topic ideas. After having lots of analysis and getting feedback from every team member, we ended up by selecting 2 games. Now, its time to select the one out of 2 games. We again started discussion to decide which game will best suited with our requirements. Everyone has given their feedback of what they feel will be the feasible with our requirements.
Our next discussion topic was to decide which technology to use to implement it. After getting feedback from every team memeber, we decided to use java as it will be the efficient to implement design patterns. 
Then we started list down all the tasks needed and what all design patterns we can implement in this game. Before taking any decision, we were taking feedback from each and every team member. 
Based on team's feedback, we listed down all the tasks. Now its time to distribute the tasks amongselves. As I was promoting the xp value: Feedback, I analysed all tasks, the requirements, additional functionalities and provided the feedback along with design patterns we can implement. I made sure to take feedback from every team member about the tasks they want to pick. We distributed all the tasks and design patterns to implement among all team members.
