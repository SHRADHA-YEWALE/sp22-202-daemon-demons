### XP Value : Team Feedback
We team members had our 1st meeting in the 1st week. Every team member were exploring the project topic ideas. After having lots of analysis and getting feedback from every team member, we ended up by selecting 2 games. Now, its time to select the one out of 2 games. We again started discussion to decide which game will best suited with our requirements. Everyone has given their feedback of what they feel will be the feasible with our requirements.
Our next discussion topic was to decide which technology to use to implement it. After getting feedback from every team memeber, we decided to use java as it will be the efficient to implement design patterns. 
Then we started list down all the tasks needed and what all design patterns we can implement in this game. Before taking any decision, we were taking feedback from each and every team member. 
Based on team's feedback, we listed down all the tasks. Now its time to distribute the tasks amongselves. As I was promoting the xp value: Feedback, I analysed all tasks, the requirements, additional functionalities and provided the feedback along with design patterns we can implement. I made sure to take feedback from every team member about the tasks they want to pick. We distributed all the tasks and design patterns to implement among all team members.


## Week 2 (April 17th to April 23rd)

### Finished last week
* Task 1 : Design skeleton for obverver pattern
* Task 2 : Detect Hit
* Task 3 : Score Card


### Time spend
* Task 1 : 4 hrs
* Task 2: 3 hrs
* Task 3 : 3 hrs

### Planned next week
* Task 1 : Integrate detect hit with Jet
* Task 2 : Display scores for jet1 and jet 2

### Bloker
No blockers

### XP Value : Team Feedback
After dividing the tasks and reponsibilities, we have started implementing the assigned features. I started desiging the skeleton for observer pattern for score module. While designing the classes, I communicated with Dylan and took his feedback since our modules are interconnected and need to be integrated later. Moreover, We decided to make separate git branches and then create pull request to main branch after done with feature work to merge the working code to main branch so that main branch should have working up to date code. I created separate branches for my journal as well my feature score. I learnt git, greenfoot and also updated progress of my tasks in git.

Also, we all team members worked on designing the architecutre diagram for the project by collaborating and taking feedback from each memeber on respective functionalities.

## Week 3 (April 24th to April 30th)

### Finished last week
1. Observer pattern refactoring for score - 2hrs
2. Jet1 & Jet2 as a concrete subject to detect hit - 1hr
3. Update jet1 & jet2 score - 4hrs
4. Display jet1 & jet 2 score - 4hrs

### Time spend
* Task 1 : 2 hrs
* Task 2: 1 hr
* Task 3 : 4 hrs
* Task 4 : 4 hrs


### Planned next week
1. Integrating score feature with jets.
2. Testing update, display score for jet1 & jet2

### Blocker
No Blockers.

### XP Value : Team Feedback
All team members worked on their respective features. The observer pattern I have implemented was not much fitted with overall implementation. After doing analysis, I have given feedback of my analysis to Dylan(as he was implementing Jet & Bullet features). We had a quick zoom meeting to discuss on how after hitting bullets to jets will detect the hit and update repective scores. After getting feedback of the Jet& bullet implementation , we have changed the design for jet, bullet and for score also. I tried to finish the implementation and design of score feature with observer pattern.

## Week 4 (May 1st to May 7th)

### Finished last week
1. Integrate update score for jet1 & jet2
2. Integrate score display on screen score for jet1 & jet2
3. Testing of update score and score display for jet1 & jet
4. Reset score after game over and game continue menu

### Time spend
* Task 1 : 5 hrs
* Task 2 : 6 hr
* Task 3 : 5 hrs
* Task 4 : 1 hrs

### Planned next week
* Code clean and javadoc for each methods
* Draw deployment diagram
* Update README.md with information

### Blocker
No Blockers

### XP Value : Team Feedback
This week all team members were mostly working on integrating their features with the game. The majority of tasks include integration and testing of the features along with whole functionality of game. All team memebers gathering the information and feedback from other team members to get information and feedback about the feature they worked on in order to integrate it with their own feature. I integrated my score feature in the game and co-ordinate with sandesh and dylan to understand Jet, Bullet and Timer feature. I also tested update score and display score for jet1 & jet2 with all edge case scenarios. Moreover, while testing the whole game, I got to know that the score of the players were not reseting to 0. So I also implemented the reset score feature. I performed the testing everytime I was adding any new feature or making code change. I have given feedback to other team mates about few bugs and defects I encountered during the testing of features. Other team mates has also given me feedback about the score not updating or wrongly updating. I fixed all the defects in score feature.
