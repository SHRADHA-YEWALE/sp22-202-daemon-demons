Worked primarily on the jet and the bullet components. This involved movement, shooting, and overall behavior such as bullet fire rate and range. 
In addition, worked to create an easier means of detecting hits and updating score by generating subclasses of Jet and Bullet.
Implemented strategy pattern for the jet movement controls, with the different control schemes being different strategies.

* Worked on implementing the `Menu`, `Instructions`, `Settings` and `GameSettings` screen
* Implemented the `Explosion` and `Instructions` class and added code to animate the game background to enhance the user experience
* Used the `Command Pattern` to implement the Menu and Settings screen. Created `Buttons` and `MenuCommand` class and required invoker and receiver interfaces to implement the Command Pattern. All buttons used in the game are in `Buttons` class and the command pattern is used to assign functionality to buttons and labels.
* Added game assets including the title screen, background music, explosion sound, bullet sounds and the menu navigation sounds
* Created the `Player` class to get the Player's information from the user when the game is started 
* Added the `Jet` and `Bullet` speed configurations in the settings screen, fixed score display bug, and updated the `WinnerBanner` class to enhance user experience
* Worked on the project documentation and class diagrams and helped the team in creating the user story video
