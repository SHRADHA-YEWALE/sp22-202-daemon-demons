Worked primarily on the jet and the bullet components. This involved movement, shooting, and overall behavior such as bullet fire rate and range. 
In addition, worked to create an easier means of detecting hits and updating score by generating subclasses of Jet and Bullet.
Implemented strategy pattern for the jet movement controls, with the different control schemes being different strategies.
